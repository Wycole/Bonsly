CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:84 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindOpenImageDenoise.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "OpenImageDenoise", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "OpenImageDenoise"
  with any of the following names:

    OpenImageDenoiseConfig.cmake
    openimagedenoise-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "OpenImageDenoise" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "OpenImageDenoise_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "OpenImageDenoise" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
